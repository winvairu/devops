DESCRIPTION
     The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.  The file operands are processed in command-line order.  If file is a single dash (‘-’) or absent, cat reads from the standard input.  If file is a UNIX domain
     socket, cat connects to it and then reads it until EOF.  This complements the UNIX domain binding capability available in inetd(8).

     The options are as follows:



















     -b      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.

     -e      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display a dollar sign (‘$’) at the end of each line.

     -l      Set an exclusive advisory lock on the standard output file descriptor.  This lock is set using fcntl(2) with the F_SETLKW command.  If the output file is already locked, cat will block until the lock is acquired.

     -n      Number the output lines, starting at 1.

     -s      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be single spaced.

     -t      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display tab characters as ‘^I’.

     -u      Disable output buffering.

     -v      Display non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control characters print as ‘^X’ for control-X; the delete character (octal 0177) prints as ‘^?’.  Non-ASCII characters (with the high bit set) are printed as ‘M-’ (for meta)
             followed by the character for the low 7 bits.
